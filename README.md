# HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION:
# OVERVIEW:
The House Price Prediction project aims to develop a robust machine learning model capable of predicting the prices of houses based on various features. This predictive model will assist homebuyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions about property transactions. By leveraging historical data and advanced machine learning techniques, the project seeks to provide accurate and reliable predictions in the dynamic real estate market.
# DATA SET:
The project will utilize a dataset containing relevant information about houses, such as square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location, amenities, and other features that influence property prices. The dataset will be preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues.
# TECHNOLOGIES:
The project will be implemented using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib. Jupyter Notebooks will be used for interactive development and documentation.
# EXPECTED OUTCOME:
The outcome of this project is a reliable and accurate house price prediction model that can assist real estate professionals, homebuyers, and investors in making informed decisions. The model's performance will be measured against industry standards, and the project will be well-documented for future reference and collaboration.
